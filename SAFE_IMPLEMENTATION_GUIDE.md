#### PI Planning Event (2 Days)

**Day 1 Agenda**:
- Business Context Presentation (30 min)
- Product/Solution Vision (30 min)  
- Architecture Vision & Development Practices (30 min)
- Planning Context & Lunch (60 min)
- Team Breakouts - Plan & Demo Prep (4 hours)
- Draft Plan Reviews (60 min)
- Management Review & Problem Solving (30 min)

**Day 2 Agenda**:
- Planning Adjustments (30 min)

- Planning Retrospective & Moving Forward (30 min)

#### PI Planning Outputs
- **Committed PI Objectives** per team and for the ART
- **Program Board** showing features, milestones, and dependencies
- **Business Value Assignment** for each team's objectives
- **Risks and Issues** identified with ROAM classification

### Risk and Issue Management (ROAM)

**Resolved**: Issue has been addressed and closed
**Owned**: Someone has taken responsibility for the risk/issue  
**Accepted**: Risk is acknowledged as part of doing business
**Mitigated**: Actions are taken to reduce probability or impact

## Team Level Implementation

### Agile Team Structure
- **Scrum Master**: Facilitates team processes and removes impediments
- **Product Owner**: Defines and prioritizes team backlog

## Market Risk Specific Considerations

### Regulatory Alignment
- **Basel III Compliance**: Ensure initiatives support capital adequacy requirements
- **FRTB Implementation**: Align with Fundamental Review of the Trading Book
- **Stress Testing**: Support CCAR and other regulatory stress test requirements
- **ESG Integration**: Address climate risk and sustainability mandates

### Risk-Specific Metrics
- **Model Validation Cycle Time**: Time to validate and approve risk models
- **Regulatory Report Accuracy**: Quality metrics for regulatory submissions  
- **System Availability**: Uptime for critical risk calculation systems
- **Data Quality Score**: Accuracy and completeness of risk data

### Compliance and Governance
- **Model Risk Management**: Ensure proper model validation and governance
- **Data Governance**: Maintain data quality and lineage requirements
- **Audit Readiness**: Support internal and external audit activities
- **Change Control**: Manage changes to production risk systems
