# Agile Portfolio Management Dashboard for Market Risk

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a comprehensive **Agile Portfolio Management Dashboard** designed specifically for Market Risk transformation initiatives in the banking sector, following **Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)** principles. The dashboard enables portfolio managers to track epics, manage Agile Release Trains (ARTs), plan Program Increments (PIs), and monitor delivery execution.

## Business Context

In the current banking environment, market risk departments are undergoing significant technology transformations driven by:
- **Regulatory Requirements**: Basel III, FRTB, CCAR, SA-CCR compliance

## Usage Examples

### Epic Prioritization
```javascript
// Prioritize epics by business value and regulatory impact
const prioritizedEpics = epics
  .filter(epic => epic.regulatoryDriver === 'Basel III')
  .sort((a, b) => b.businessValue - a.businessValue);
```

### ART Capacity Management
```javascript
// Calculate ART utilization across all trains
const avgUtilization = arts.reduce((sum, art) => 
  sum + art.utilization, 0) / arts.length;
```

### PI Planning Metrics
```javascript
// Track planning effectiveness
const planningEffectiveness = {
  confidenceScore: piPlanning.confidenceScore,
  dependenciesResolved: piPlanning.dependenciesResolved,
  risksIdentified: piPlanning.risksIdentified
};
```

## SAFe Alignment

This dashboard implements core SAFe practices:
