## Development Standards

### Code Style

#### JavaScript
- Use modern ES6+ syntax
- Follow consistent naming conventions:
  - `camelCase` for variables and functions
  - `PascalCase` for classes and constructors
  - `UPPER_CASE` for constants
- Add JSDoc comments for functions and classes
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused

```javascript
/**
 * Calculates portfolio health score based on epic status distribution
 * @param {Array} epics - Array of epic objects
 * @returns {number} Health score between 0 and 100
 */
function calculatePortfolioHealth(epics) {
    const statusCounts = epics.reduce((counts, epic) => {
        counts[epic.status] = (counts[epic.status] || 0) + 1;
        return counts;
    }, {});
    
    // Implementation logic...
}
```

#### CSS
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Organize rules logically (layout, typography, colors)
- Use CSS custom properties for themes and consistency
- Follow BEM naming convention for complex components
- Include responsive design considerations

```css
/* Component: Epic Card */
.epic-card {
    display: flex;
    padding: var(--spacing-md);
    border-radius: var(--border-radius);
    background-color: var(--color-surface);
}

.epic-card__header {
    margin-bottom: var(--spacing-sm);
}

.epic-card__title {
    font-size: var(--text-lg);
    font-weight: var(--font-weight-semibold);
    color: var(--color-text);
}
```

#### HTML
